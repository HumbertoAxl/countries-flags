# Flag Guesser

Welcome to the Flag Guesser, a web-based game that challenges you to guess the country name based on the flag shown on the screen. A random flag will be drawn until you guess all of them correctly.

## Demo

You can try the game yourself by visiting the [live demo](https://flags.humbertoaxl.dev/).

## About this project

This was my first personal project, and I created it to learn Vue 3 while I was quarantining after moving to Australia. After its initial release, I left it untouched until recently when I implemented a highscore system that is stored in Firebase and did some cleanup in the JavaScript code. The popups are shown using SweetAlert2.
The code is not where I want it to be, maybe in the future I'll rewrite it.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you have fun playing the game!
